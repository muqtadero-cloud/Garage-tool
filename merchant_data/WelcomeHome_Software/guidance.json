If the BU go-live date is unavailable, use the number of days specified in the initial subscription period section. For example, if the agreement specifies “120 days after Order Form execution,” then add 120 days to the execution date and use that as the service start date. If neither a BU go-live date nor a specified period is available, default to the contract signing date.",
